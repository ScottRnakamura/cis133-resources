My favorite HTML resource is this Youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz0aGYrrlhU

Biggest reason is because it basically is a crash course that teaches you everything you need to know about HTML in concise lessons. It teaches you everything from making a title to adding hyperlinks.

My favorite CSS resource is this site https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps

This website is an introduction to CSS and highlights all the basics you would need to know about styling a website. I will for sure be looking back to this website for the first couple weeks.
